# PoliceScannerSimulator
This is a simple console application which mimicks actual police radio traffic. It uses real streets from a text file and creates an address, as well as random calls.
This application is a console application which uses randomization to generate different police calls and radio traffic based off of the call types and street names provided in two text files. Calls are generated automatically every few seconds and different officers respond to the calls based upon several variables.
